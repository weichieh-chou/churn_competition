count_cancel has to be dropped: every user that churned went on that page and no others

super high correlation between the counts
in general high correlation between coefficients
problem: some regions don't have many people in it, so the churn_rate is super off - probably drop it completely



strong features so far:
thumbs_ratio, user_lifecycle_h, item_per_session, last_level
