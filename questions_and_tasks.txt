Check if predict also scales and encodes our test dataset (i think so)
Fix the feature where it says new user to less than 720 since that is too long for our dataset


!!!!!!!!Keep the best score code "seperate" so we dont loose it!!!!!!!!!!

Next steps:
--> To increase Score:
                -) Try to use different models / combine models
                -) Tune hyperparams
                -) Add Features

--> For Final submission:
                -) for report:
                    -) All features with importance
                    -) Some EDA graphs on features
                    -) Put in Corr matrix before and after
                    -) Table to show performance of differnt models (cv problem needs to be fixed, time series has to be accounted for)

                -) for repo:
                    -) make nice eda (time series and trend analysis missing)
                    -) clean up code
